## Introduction
This repository demonstrates the comparisons on DeepDream between several different architectures. Due to the fact that different trained baseline models have different validation/test accuracy, we tried to keep those accuraies as close as possible. The target test models are listed as below:

* Convolutional Neural Networks (baseline)
* Capsule Neural Networks (baseline)

## Train the model
### CNN baseline

```
python experiment.py
```
